- pandas
- numpy
- keras
- tensorflow
- matplotlib

- json

##### Import Data Set

The uploaded code does not contain required data set. You can put "'**train_data.csv**" and "**test_data.csv**" given in Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs410ei339-fall18-stock-price-prediction under the corresponding directory, same directory that the code is in.

###Run the Code

##### Code in “model1”

For code in “./model1”, run it with:

> python predict_by_lstm.py

#####Code in “model2”

For code in "./model2", run it with:

> python runLSTM.py
>
> python saveResults.py

NOTE: our final results are produced form "./model1"
