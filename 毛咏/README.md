# Two ways to predict the mid price

#### **LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction**

The structure of layers of the network refers to the repository **LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction**. The <a href = "https://github.com/jaungiers/LSTM-Neural-Network-for-Time-Series-Prediction/blob/master/config.json">config</a> of this repository shows the detail structure and I made some change to optimize it.

#### Machine Learning for Forecasting Mid Price Movement using Limit Order Book Data

The idea of the second model is from the paper named as the header **Machine Learning for Forecasting Mid Price Movement using Limit Order Book Data**. <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07861">Link to the paper</a>.
